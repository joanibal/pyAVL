# pyAVL Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for `pyAVL`, a stripped-down version of Mark Drela and Harold Youngren's famous AVL code wrapped in python with `f2py`.
This wrapper allows for seamless integration of AVL into larger models and parameter sweeps, providing users with access to more data than available through the traditional file output.
Dive in to learn about installation, analysis, and optimization with `pyAVL`.

Before working with pyAVL it is useful to familiarize yourself with AVL.
